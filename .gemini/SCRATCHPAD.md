## 🚀 Current Session: Phase 2 - Core Pillars (Shop & Flow)

**Focus:** Building out the subdomain structure for 'Shop' and enhancing 'Flow'.

## 📍 Project Context
*   **Name:** Drag River Creative
*   **Location:** Haliburton, Ontario
*   **Vision:** Creative ecosystem (Apparel, Flow, Retreat, Studio, Events).
*   **Current State:**
    *   **Phase 1 Complete**: Foundation laid, v0.0.1 released.
    *   **Flow**: Basic router and static view in place at `flow.dragriver.ca`.
    *   **Shop**: Not started.

## 📋 Immediate Action Plan
- [ ] **Shop Setup**: Create directory structure for `shop` subdomain (`public/shop/`).
- [ ] **Shop Controller**: Create `public/shop/index.php`.
- [ ] **Shop View**: Create `public/shop/shop.html` placeholder.
- [ ] **Flow Data**: Connect `public/flow/index.php` to real weather API (OpenWeatherMap).

## 🧠 Discussion Points / Questions
1.  **Shop Tech**: Are we using a simple JS cart (Snipcart/Stripe) or a full PHP solution? (Roadmap says JS-based initially).
2.  **Shared Assets**: Ensure `shop` uses the absolute paths to `public/styles.css` like `flow` does.

## 💡 Notes
*   *Gemini*: Phase 1 is wrapped. Moving to specific pillar implementation.
*   *Creative*: **DRIPS** Acronym: (Dr)ag (Ri)ver (Ps)yche. Fits well with "Flow" (water) and "Apparel" (style/drip).
